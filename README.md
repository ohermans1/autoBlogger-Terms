## Terms and Conditions

This document outlines the terms and conditions for using autoBlogger. Please read these terms carefully before using the app.

## The Important Stuff:

### Content Generation and Liability

The creators of autoBlogger are not responsible for the content generated by the app. autoBlogger uses 3rd party AI software (Chat-GPT) to automatically create and post blogs on users' Shopify stores. The user acknowledges and agrees that the content generated by autoBlogger is based on AI algorithms and cannot be guaranteed to be perfect or free from errors. It is completely the responsibility of the store owner to check and correct any content or images. 

Please note that the information provided by autoBlogger is based on data available up to the GPT training cutoff date. Topics requiring information after that date may result in blogs that are not accurate, as the AI's knowledge is limited to what was available up to that point.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is influenced by numerous factors. While autoBlogger focuses on two crucial aspects - backlinking and blogging - it is not an all-in-one SEO tool. Like any SEO approach, results are not guaranteed, and success may vary based on various factors, including competition, content quality, and website structure. As with all SEO tools, we want to emphasize that no refunds will be provided based on the SEO outcomes you experience.

By using autoBlogger's services, you acknowledge that any changes in search traffic to your store website may occur due to various factors, and autoBlogger is not responsible for such fluctuations. Possible reasons for changes in search traffic include, but are not limited to, search engine algorithm updates, website changes, and external market forces. It is important to note that autoBlogger bears no responsibility for any change in search traffic or search metrics and cannot guarantee specific outcomes.

### Refunds and Subscriptions

Refunds are not offered for forgetting to cancel subscriptions or for any other reason outside of autoBlogger's control.

### Backlink Program

By joining the back-link program, you consent to the sharing and posting of your store URL on other stores' blogs. You also agree that links to other stores may occasionally be posted on your blogs. Please note that autoBlogger bears no responsibility for the content of any linked stores.

## Terms and Conditions:

### Acceptable Use

The user agrees to use autoBlogger for lawful purposes only. The user will not use autoBlogger to create or distribute any content that is defamatory, offensive, or illegal.

### Fees and Payment

The user agrees to pay any fees associated with using autoBlogger. The creators of autoBlogger reserve the right to change the fees at any time. The user will be notified in advance of any changes to the fees.

### Limitation of Liability

The creators of autoBlogger will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use autoBlogger, including but not limited to, loss of profits, data, or business.

### Termination

The creators of autoBlogger reserve the right to terminate the user's access to autoBlogger at any time for any reason. The user may terminate their use of autoBlogger at any time by uninstalling the app from their Shopify store.

### Privacy Policy

The creators of autoBlogger take the privacy of our users seriously. We will only use the information provided by the user in accordance with Shopify's Privacy Policy. By using autoBlogger, the user agrees to the terms of our Shopify's Privacy Policy.

### Disclaimer

autoBlogger is provided "as is" without any warranties, expressed or implied. The creators of autoBlogger make no representations or warranties of any kind, including but not limited to, the accuracy or completeness of the content generated by autoBlogger.

### Indemnification

The user agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the creators of autoBlogger from any and all claims, damages, expenses, and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with the user's use of autoBlogger or any violation of these terms and conditions.

### Modification of Terms and Conditions

The creators of autoBlogger reserve the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. The user will be notified of any changes to these terms and conditions.

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the creators of autoBlogger are located. The user agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.

### Back-Link Program

By participating in the back-link program, you acknowledge and agree to these terms and conditions. These terms constitute a binding agreement between you and autoBlogger.

By joining the back-link program, you grant autoBlogger permission to share and post your store URL on other stores' blogs. This enables increased visibility and potential traffic to your store.

As part of the back-link program, your blogs may occasionally feature links to other stores. This reciprocal arrangement aims to foster cross-promotion and mutual benefits among participating users.

autoBlogger assumes no responsibility for the content of any linked stores. Each store is solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of its own content.

Once the back-links are published, you agree not to remove them without prior consent from autoBlogger. Removing back-links may result in termination from the program.

autoBlogger reserves the right to modify or terminate the back-link program at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review these terms periodically to stay informed about any changes.
